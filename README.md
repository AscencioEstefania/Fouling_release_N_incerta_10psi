The group of Prof. Rasulev is focused on development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictive models to design novel polymeric materials, nanomaterials and to predict their various properties, including toxicity, solubility, fouling release properties, elasticity, degradation rate, biodegradation, etc. The group applies computational chemistry, machine learning and cheminformatics methods for modeling, data analysis and development of predictive structure-property relationship models to find structural factors responsible for activity of investigated materials.

# Fouling release ML prediction

# It is a free web-based application designed for predicting fouling release performance.

Marine biofouling is the undesired accumulation of microorganisms, such as bacteria, algal spores, and diatoms like Navicula incerta, along with larger marine organisms, on submerged surfaces in seawater. N. incerta, for instance, settles on surfaces through gravity or water currents and secretes adhesive polymers to secure attachment and facilitate movement. These microorganisms rapidly multiply, forming dense biofilms that can reach up to 500 Î¼m in thickness. This process not only accelerates the degradation of protective coatings on marine structures but also increases hydrodynamic drag, leading to higher fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, biofouling contributes to the spread of invasive species, causing significant ecological disruption and financial losses. Addressing biofouling is crucial, as it poses severe environmental and economic challenges, such as increased operational costs for marine vessels and long-term damage to marine ecosystems. Effective prevention and mitigation strategies are essential to minimize its detrimental impact.
